# Introduction

Welcome to the Safety-Critical Rust Coding Guidelines.

This book is produced by the [Coding Guidelines Subcommittee](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/tree/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines) of the [Safety-Critical Rust Consortium](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium).

The book is intended to mirror the layout of the [Ferrocene Language Specification](https://spec.ferrocene.dev/index.html) in order to have strong coverage of the many aspects of the Rust programming language.
