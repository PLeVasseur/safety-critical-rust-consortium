6. Discussion session
   * "Under what circumstances is `panic`\-ing safety-critical software okay?" (Félix)  
     * Relevant [issue](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/158)  
   * “Should we create a list of rules we intend to create? I can imagine that such a list could facilitate contributions of people who don't have the big picture but are willing to take a single rule and just write it. If so, what is a good format and where should it live to maximize contributor experience”
     * Relevant [issue](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/197)
   * “(Where) do we have a place to cover higher level concepts? I'm thinking of patterns like Newtype and Typestate which can reduce errors significantly.”

7. Round table
